# Abilities
Ability scores determine the base potential of a character. They are used as the basis of success for any action performed in the game. The ability may also affect a dice roll, adding, or subtracting, from the total. 
They are [[Determining Ability Scores|determined]] during character creation and certain choices can change one or more of these values, for the better or worse.

# Skills
Skills are subclasses of the main 6 abilities and go into more specifisity. For example, if you're attempting to sneak past an enemy, you would roll *Dexterity*, but *Stealth* instead. Skills take the dice modifier from the related ability, but they can be different depending on [[Proficiency Bonus]] and more.
