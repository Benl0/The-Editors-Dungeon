# Proficiencies
Proficiencies are determined by a character's [[Races]], [[Classes]] and [[Backgrounds]] (their story). As the name implies, it shows what a character is particularly good at. These can be Weapons, Saving Throws or Skills and Tools.
## Proficiency Modifier
Your proficiency modifier is noted down in your class table. Starting at +2, it will increase as you level up.
## Marking Proficiency
- Saving throws & Skills
	- Next to each skill's modifier is a little circle. Colour it in to mark proficiency
- All other
	- Below the skills list, is a text box for all other proficiencies. This can be weapons and items, but also character specific such as [[Dwarf|Dwarve's]] Stonecutting.
## Using Proficiency
Throughout gameplay, there will be moments that require specific skills or actions to be rolled for (e.g. Stealth). A d20 is rolled and the relevant bonus is added but no more than once. The bonus can multiplied (doubled or halved).
