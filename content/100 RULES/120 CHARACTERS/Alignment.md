| **Good**    | Can be counted on to do the right <br>thing as expected by society.           | Does the best the can to help others<br>according to their needs.     | Acts as their conscience directs<br>with little regard for what others expect. |
| **Neutral** | Acts in accordance with the law<br>tradition, or personal codes.              | Doesnâ€™t take sides, only doing<br>what seems best at the time.        | Follows their own whims, holding<br>personal freedom above all else.           |
| **Evil**    | Takes what they want within the<br>limits of traditions, loyalties or orders. | Does whatever they can get away with<br>without compassion or qualms. | Acts with arbitrary violence spurred<br>by a primal feeling within.            |
